# Beldad Portfolio — Vite + React

Quick migration of the static HTML/CSS portfolio into a Vite + React app.

Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Notes
Setting the contact email

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root (do NOT commit this to source control) and add your email:

```env
VITE_CONTACT_EMAIL=you@example.com
```

2. Restart the dev server if it's running. The contact form will open the visitor's email client with your address prefilled.

An example file is included as `.env.example`.
